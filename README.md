# CEPL.GLOP

This package lets GLOP act as a host for [CEPL](https://www.github.com/cbaggers/cepl)

## What?

CEPL (like GL) relies on other libraries for managing the creation of a GL context, interaction with the Window manager and handling of input sources. The libraries that provide this functionality for CEPL are called hosts.

This is a host for CEPL which uses the GLOP library for creating the context etc.
